 This project is on Sorting Algoritms and Big O Notation.
This is a team project between Mr Manuel Ibibo and Mrs
Omena Egbusiri. 
In this Project the different algorithm types are explored ,
In every scenerio, we were to indicate whether or not the time 
complexity for each algorithm used were in their best case, average case 
or worse case scenerio.
